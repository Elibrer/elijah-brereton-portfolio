## Description

This repository contains code for the portfolio website I have built for myself. It showcases various projects that I've worked on so far, and will be a platform that I continuously update throughout my learning journey.

The portfolio shows off the skills I've learned so far as far as HTML and CSS programming goes, with styling elements displaying the various things I've been taught and self-learned from research. 

I will continue to work on this page as I absorb more and more information throughout the next few months, setting myself up with useable portfolio to show off to potential clients and employers.
